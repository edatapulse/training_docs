The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into human-centric fields has gained significant attention, particularly within the domain of human science. 
Imagine your mind as a garden and AI as a new type of seed. This topic explores how these AI "seeds" are growing alongside our thoughts, changing the landscape of our minds.
This paper explores the fascinating partnership between AI and human cognition, unveiling how these smart systems are reshaping the way we think, feel and see the world.


This study digs into some cool questions:

•Brain Changes: Are our brains changing due to frequent usage of AI ?
•AI Friends: How does interacting with AI buddies change ourselves and understanding of others?
•New Thinking: Can AI help us think in new ways we couldn't before?

Ultimately, AI and human minds are growing together, like plants sharing a pot. 
This "sentient symbiosis" wraps up with promising groundbreaking ideas about how humans and AI can evolve together, becoming smarter and kinder.
We must also need to carful to keep our unique human spark alive and remains bright. 
It's an exciting time to be both alive and conscious!
