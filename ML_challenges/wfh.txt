I would like to inform you that I was suffering from high fever since 01 July 2025 and was admitted to the hospital on 03 July 2025. After medical evaluation, I was diagnosed with Dengue fever, and my platelet count had dropped significantly. I was discharged on 07 July 2025 and am currently under recovery.

As per my doctorâ€™s advice, I am required to take complete rest for the next two weeks to ensure full recovery and avoid any complications. In light of this, I kindly request your approval to work from home from 09 July 2025 to 22 July 2025. I will ensure that all my responsibilities are managed effectively during this period and will remain reachable for any meetings or urgent requirements.

I appreciate your support and understanding during this time. Please let me know if any documentation is needed from my end.
